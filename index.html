  Hi, My name is <strong>Roshan Kedar</strong> and I currenty live in Baner,Pune, India.
  I am 25 years old. I am a Computer Engineer with Masters degree in Computer Science from VJTI.
  I like technology, and most of free time is invested in watching documentraies and trying out new technologies.
  I like discussing and writing about technology and it's consequences on human lives and minds.
  I also like to carry out social experiments where technology can play a role as a tool.
  This website is a part of one of such social experiment. 
 </p>

 <p>
  I like reading books.
  Mostly shorter books with stories which I can relate to things happening around me.
  And when I was young I used to read many books and nearly all newspaper articles, magazines, etc.
  And as the time passed and I got the hold of mobile and internet, my reading rate declined.
  Of course I was not using internet just for social media.
  And I still do a lot a reading online, but I have nearly stopped reading full books.
  Now I read a book only if the topic of book is of my interest and I have to charge my phone.
  But now I watch videos, mostly educational and documentaries, I am getting lots of information than I could have got from books.
  But still I can't read longer texts like very long articles.
  And I think technology has changed the way I used to read.  
 </p>

 <p>
  And as a social engineer I think we don't read books much these days because there is very less interaction in the process.
  Book reading is a slow process. We have to invest lot of time in it. 
  Also the thinking burden is always there to understand what author wants to convey. 
  Also we have a great disturbing device which is always looking for an attention.
  But It won't be fair to blame technology for all of this without testing it.
  What if technology is used in a good way to tackle the interaction issue?
 </p>

  This website is a repository of books I have in possession.
  Some of mine, some borrowed from friends.
  And I would like to share these books with anyone who wants to read it.
  There is no delivery service and I will personally deliver these books to you.
  With a condition, you have to talk with me about your reading experience. 
  It can be daily,weekly, monthly or even just once after you finish it.
  With every book I would like to share these experieces with my own experinces with the book on this website.
  There are no social media sharing buttons here. No likes, no comments.
  everything should happen in good old ways. Talking to each other.
